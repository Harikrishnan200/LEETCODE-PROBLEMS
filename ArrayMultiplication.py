# 3264. Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations 


# You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier.

# You need to perform k operations on nums. In each operation:

# Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears first.
# Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier.
# Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,1,3,5,6], k = 5, multiplier = 2

# Output: [8,4,6,5,6]

# Explanation:

# Operation	Result
# After operation 1	[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
# After operation 2	[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]
# After operation 3	[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]
# After operation 4	[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]
# After operation 5	[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2], k = 3, multiplier = 4

# Output: [16,8]

# Explanation:

# Operation	Result
# After operation 1	[4, 2]
# After operation 2	[4, 8]
# After operation 3	[16, 8]
